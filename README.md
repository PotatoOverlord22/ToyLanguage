<h1> Interpreter built on top of Java (Java does all the heavy lifting). </h1>

<ul>
  <li> You can run the "Interpreter.java" file for the text-menu version or the "Main.java" for the Javafx GUI version. </li>
  <li> The project supports stack and heap memory allocation, type checking, logical, relational and arithmetic operations, multiple types of loops, file I/O operations, multithreading and synchronization mechanisms. </li>
  <li> The programs have to be added manually in the Main.java file for now, adding a parser with proper syntax checking is a bit of work</li>
</ul>
